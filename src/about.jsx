            <p>I learn so I can build, ship and help. From tweeting Ariana Grande lyrics with a high-school Python bot to rolling out a one-click document tool for my dad’s clinic, I turn curiosity → code → impact. A year in Sapporo taught me Japanese, storytelling and fast adaptation; now I’m sprinting through HTML/CSS/JS, shipping Habitue with my brother and diving into every hackathon I can find.</p>
